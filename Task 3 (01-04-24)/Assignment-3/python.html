          Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its
          design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of
          significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and
          garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
          including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and
          functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries
          included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
          Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a
          successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in
          1991 as Python 0.9.0 Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0,
          released in 2008, was a major revision not completely
          backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in
          2020, was the last release of Python 2.
