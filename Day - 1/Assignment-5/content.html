            <p>A traditional breakfast food made of fermented rice-and-lentil batter, a dosa is much like a crispy thin crepe. Its accompanied by sambar (a hot lentil soup) and coconut chutney.
              Masala dosas are stuffed with a spicy mash of potato and onion; plain dosas are hollow; rava dosas are made from semolina; and some new-age variants get creative with fillings such as cottage cheese or mixed vegetables.

            <p>The fastest form of "fast food" consists of pre-cooked meals which reduce waiting periods to mere seconds. Other fast food outlets, primarily hamburger outlets such as McDonald's and Burger King use mass-produced, pre-prepared ingredients (bagged buns and condiments, frozen beef patties, vegetables which are pre-washed, pre-sliced, or both; etc.) and cook the meat and french fries fresh, before assembling "to order".
              Fast food restaurants are traditionally distinguished by the drive-through.</p>

            <p>Yes! This fruit salad is actually a great make-ahead recipe, as the flavors need time to meld in the fridge before serving. Make the dish the day before, then store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator until you're ready to serve it.This fruit salad is perfect for a backyard bbq or any occasion. There are never leftovers! This is one of my favorite fruit salad recipes, as I think the citrusy sauce really makes it. This salad is tastier the longer you can let it soak in its juices. I prefer 3 to 4 hours in the refrigerator before I serve it.</p>
